## Introduction

This project is designed to control a mobile differential drive robot.

All robot parameters and pin numbers are in the file lib/InitData/constants.h

## Robot design

The robot includes the following devices and sensors:

- Single board computer **Raspberry pi 4 8gb**
- Hardware platform **Arduino Mega 2560**
- Motor driver **TB6612FNG**
- Hall-Effect Magnetic Encoder **AS5600 x2**
- I2C Multiplexer **CJMCU-9548 (for encoders)**

Below is the connection of all elements

## Dependencies

### **PlatformioIO**

This code works on Arduino Mega 2560 using **PlatformioIO**

You can download [PlatformIO Core](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation.html#piocore-install-shell-commands) separately.

Or use the [Visual Studio Code IDE Extension](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode).

(Please note that you do not need to install PlatformIO Core if you are going to use PlatformIO IDE. PlatformIO Core is built into PlatformIO IDE and you will be able to use it within PlatformIO IDE Terminal.)

### AS5600

This code uses a third party library AS5600 licensed under the [GPL-3.0 License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/)

## Classes

## Using

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/industrial-robotics-lab/differential-drive-robot.git
```
Go to the project folder:
```bash
cd differential-drive-robot
```

For remote control, it is necessary that the robot (Raspberry Pi) and the PC have a connection to the same Wi-Fi network.
You need to find out the IP address of the Raspberry Pi, this can be done with the following command:
```bash
ifconfig
```
(section wlan0: inet \<IP-adress\>)

This IP address must be specified in the scripts **SocketServer.py** and **SocketClient.py** (variable HOST).

Start the server on Raspberry Pi:
```bash
python3 scripts/SocketServer.py
```


Run the client on PC:
```bash
python3 scripts/SocketClient.py
```

### Robot control
For control is used the keyboard of your PC:  
`w` - forward  
`x` - back  
`a` - left turn  
`d` - right turn  
`s` - stop moving  
`e` - increase the speed of rotation of the wheels  
`q` - reduce the speed of rotation of the wheels  
`Ctrl+c` - shutdown client and server
